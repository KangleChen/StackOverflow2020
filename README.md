## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

- Which languages are mostly used by professional developers?
- Which languages are mostly desired by professional developers?
- Is this conclusion influeced by countries?
- Do developers with CS background and from other undergraduate major make the same choice?

## File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
The results are also stored in the `.html` file. 
The survey data is stored in directory 'data'.

## Results
- `javascript` is popular all over the world. 
- `python` is especially popular in China.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
